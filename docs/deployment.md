# Deployment

## Session Storage

StimulusReflex configures :cache\_store to be the Rails session storage mechanism. In a production environment, you'll want to move beyond the Rails default :memory\_store cache in favor of a more robust solution.

The recommended solution is to use Redis as your cache store, and `:cache_store` as your session store. Memcache is also an excellent cache store; we prefer Redis because it offers a far broader range of data structures and querying mechanisms. If you're not using Redis' advanced features, both tools are equally well-suited to key:value string caching.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure that your Redis instance is configured to use the `lru-volatile` expiration strategy with expiring session keys.
{% endhint %}

Many Rails projects are already using Redis for ActiveJob queues and Russian doll caching, making the decision to use it for session storage easy and incremental. Add the `redis` and `hiredis` gems to your Gemfile:

{% code title="Gemfile" %}
```ruby
gem "redis", ">= 4.0", :require => ["redis", "redis/connection/hiredis"]
gem "hiredis"
```
{% endcode %}

Then configure your environments to suit your caching strategy and pool size:

{% code title="config/environments/production.rb" %}
```ruby
config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {url: ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL") { "redis://localhost:6379/1" }}
config.session_store :cache_store,
  key: "_session",
  compress: true,
  pool_size: 5,
  expire_after: 1.year
```
{% endcode %}

Another powerful option for session storage is to use the [activerecord-session\_store](https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store) gem and keep your sessions in the database. This technique requires some additional setup in the form of a migration that will create a `sessions` table in your database.

Database-backed session storage offers a single source of truth in a production environment that might be preferable to a sharded Redis cluster for high-volume deployments. However, it's also important to weigh this against the additional strain this will put on your database server, especially in high-traffic scenarios.

Regardless of which option you choose, keep an eye on your connection pools and memory usage.

## AnyCable

{% hint style="danger" %}
"But does it scale?"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Yes.
{% endhint %}

We're excited to announce that StimulusReflex now works with [AnyCable](https://github.com/anycable/anycable), a library which allows you to use any WebSocket server \(written in any language\) as a replacement for your Ruby WebSocket server. You can read more about the dramatic scalability possible with AnyCable in [this post](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/anycable-actioncable-on-steroids).

We'd love to hear your battle stories regarding the number of simultaneous connections you can achieve both with and without AnyCable. Anecdotal evidence suggests that you can realistically squeeze ~4000 connections with native ActionCable, whereas AnyCable should allow roughly 10,000 connections **per node**. Of course, the message delivery speed will dip as you start to approach the upper limit, so if you are working on a project successful enough to have this problem, you are advised to switch.

Getting to this point required significant effort and cooperation between members of both projects. You can try out a preview of the upcoming AnyCable v1.0.0 release today.

1. Add `gem "anycable-rails", "1.0.0.rc2"` to your `Gemfile`.
2. Install `anycable-go` v1.0.0.rc1 \([binaries](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-go/releases) available here, Docker images are also [available](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/anycable/anycable-go/tags?page=1&name=preview)\).
3. If you are using the session object, you must select a cache store that is not MemoryStore, which is not compatible with AnyCable.

There is also a brand-new installation wizard which you can access via `rails g anycable:setup` after the gem has been installed.

Official AnyCable documentation for StimulusReflex can be found [here](https://docs.anycable.io/v1/#/ruby/stimulus_reflex). If you notice any issues with AnyCable support, please tell us about it [here](https://github.com/hopsoft/stimulus_reflex/issues/46).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're looking to authenticate AnyCable connections with Devise, the documentation for that process is [here](https://docs.anycable.io/v1/#/ruby/authentication), and there's a good discussion about this process [here](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-rails/issues/127).
{% endhint %}

## Turbolinks

We strongly recommend the use of Turbolinks for your applications.

In addition to the dramatic speed benefits associated with swapping the page content without having to load a new page, Turbolinks will help you minimize the resource consumption of your ActionCable connections as well.

When all of your ActionCable channels \(including StimulusReflex\) share one memoized `consumer.js` your browser doesn't have to re-establish a new websocket connection with the server on every page. Turbolinks allows your connection to be persisted between page loads.

## Connecting ActionCable to a different host

If you want to set up your ActionCable backend to accept connections from a different host, you'll need to reconfigure your setup.

First, make sure that you're serving the ActionCable endpoint:

{% code title="config/routes.rb" %}
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount ActionCable.server => '/cable'
end
```
{% endcode %}

Then, you will have to modify your `consumer.js` to connect to your application URL. Note that you can connect to secure websockets via SSL by using`wss://` instead of `ws://`

{% code title="app/javascript/channels/consumer.js" %}
```javascript
import { createConsumer } from '@rails/actioncable'
export default createConsumer('wss://myapp.com/cable')
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, tweak your production configuration. **Don't disable forgery protection unless it's not working.**

{% code title="config/environments/production.rb" %}
```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins
  config.action_cable.url = "wss://myapp.com/cable"
  config.action_cable.disable_request_forgery_protection = true # only if necessary
end
```
{% endcode %}

## Is StimulusReflex suitable for use in developing countries?

On the face, serving raw HTML to the client means a smaller download, there's no SPA dynamically rendering a page from JSON \(slow\) and draining the battery. However, the question deserves a more nuanced treatment - and not just because **some devices might not even support Websockets**.

It's simply true that the team developing StimulusReflex is working on relatively recent, non-mobile computers with subjectively fast, reliable connections to the internet. None of us are actively testing on legacy hardware.

Raw Websockets has more in common with UDP than TCP, in that there's no retry logic or acknowledgement of delivery. Messages can arrive out of order, or not at all.

ActionCable does add some reconnection and retry logic to Websockets that is mostly transparent. If you are disconnected, it will attempt to reconnect. If you try to send data while offline, it will raise an exception unless you handle it.

We offer two suggestions to developers looking to support users with slow, unreliable connections:

1. Don't put destructive database updates in your Reflex actions. Design your app to keep state mutation in your controller actions, and wrap everything important in transactions.
2. You might need to program defensively using two-stage commits. This means devising ways to acknowledge that transactions were completed. You should also construct your UI to hide action elements like buttons when your connection is dropped.

If you're working through these issues, please get in touch with us on Discord. We will work hard to help.
