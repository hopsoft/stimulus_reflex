## Verify ActionCable

If ActionCable isn't working properly in your environment, StimulusReflex cannot function.

Step one to any troubleshooting process should be "is it plugged in?"

First, run `rails generate channel test` in your Rails project folder. This will ensure that your ActionCable setup has been initialized, although you should verify that in your `app/javascript/packs/application.js` you have `import 'channels'` present.

Next, **copy and paste** the following into the two specified files, replacing their contents.

{% code title="app/channels/test\_channel.rb" %}
```ruby
class TestChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "test"
  end

  def receive(data)
    puts data["message"]
    ActionCable.server.broadcast("test", "ActionCable is connected")
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="app/javascript/channels/test\_channel.js" %}
```javascript
import consumer from './consumer'

consumer.subscriptions.create('TestChannel', {
  connected () {
    this.send({ message: 'Client is live' })
  },

  received (data) {
    console.log(data)
  }
})
```
{% endcode %}

If ActionCable is running properly, you should see `ActionCable is connected` in your browser's Console Inspector and `Client is live` in your server's STDOUT log stream.

You can feel free to remove both of these files after you're done, but leave `app/javascript/channels/consumer.js` where it is so that you can pass it to `StimulusReflex.initialize()` and share one ActionCable connection.

## Logging

### Client-Side

You might want to know the order in which your Reflexes are called, how long it took to process each Reflex or what the Reflex response payload contains. Luckily you can enable Reflex logging to your browser's Console Inspector.

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot_2020-05-05_at_01.19.44.png)

There are two ways to enable client debugging in your StimulusReflex instance.

You can provide `debug: true` to the initialize options like this:

{% code title="app/javascript/controllers/index.js" %}
```javascript
StimulusReflex.initialize(application, { consumer, debug: true })
```
{% endcode %}

You can also set debug mode after you've initialized StimulusReflex. This is especially useful if you just want to log the Reflex calls in your development environment:

{% code title="app/javascript/controllers/index.js" %}
```javascript
StimulusReflex.initialize(application, { consumer })
StimulusReflex.debug = process.env.RAILS_ENV === 'development'
```
{% endcode %}

### Server-Side

By default, ActionCable emits particularly verbose Rails logger messages. You can **optionally** discard everything but exceptions by switching to the `warn` log level, as is common in development environments:

{% code title="config/environments/development.rb" %}
```ruby
# :debug, :info, :warn, :error, :fatal, :unknown
config.log_level = :warn
```
{% endcode %}

Alternatively, you can disable ActionCable logs at the framework level. This _may_ improve performance, at the cost of not having ActionCable logs when you need them.

{% code title="config/initializers/action\_cable.rb" %}
```ruby
ActionCable.server.config.logger = Logger.new(nil)
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
We have received reports that for some developers, silencing their ActionCable logs resulted in a dramatic performance increase. If your Reflex action round-trip times are inexplicably sluggish, please do experiment with disabling logs.

Unfortunately, this is difficult to triage because it has yet to impact the StimulusReflex team members; if you have any insights, don't be shy.
{% endhint %}

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't use form serialization as a replacement for Rails remote forms

Developers who are new to and excited about StimulusReflex frequently start making plans to start using form serialization even though [they don't have a specific reason for doing so](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/working-with-forms#form-submission).

There are many good reasons to stick to Rails' form handling, the best one being that Rails is really good at it. Rails makes working with REST-ful resources really easy, with allowlist/blocklist functionality for deciding what attributes to process. There's lots of great gems and tools that augment Rails' form-handling systems that you largely give up, including the familiar magic of seeing POST and PATCH in your log files.

File uploads are not supported by form serialization, and likely never will be.

As features go, it is literally named: it's a shortcut to scooping up all of the attributes from input elements nested inside a form element, and presenting them in a familar way to your Reflex class. It's there if you need it, but if you can't immediately offer a clear explanation as to _why_ you need it, you're probably best sticking with UJS remote forms.

### Don't use CableReady from a Rails controller action

In Rails, the order of operations is Request -&gt; Controller Action -&gt; View Render -&gt; Response. If you broadcast a CableReady operation targeting the current user during the Controller Action phase, it will transmit to the browser and execute before the HTML has even been rendered. This leads to an unfortunate scenario where it appears that "nothing happened."

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't attempt to use `sleep` in your Controller Action to "slow down" a CableReady broadcast. Not only will this not work - the same problem will happen, slower - but freezing the Ruby thread means the application server has fewer resources to respond to other requests.

You never want to use `sleep` in a primary execution thread. Chances are, you should use an [ActiveJob](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) with a delayed start.
{% endhint %}

There is a partial exception to the rule: if your controller action has created an event that should be broadcast to multiple people, such as an event notification, it makes sense to broadcast that data as soon as it's relevant - ideally, via an ActiveJob so you can return your HTML faster.

Note that if this group broadcast would modify the page state of the initiating user, the DOM generated by the Controller Action should reflect the new state as though you also received the broadcast. It's easier to deliver perfect HTML up front, rather than wasting time trying to receive an event on the client.

Architecturally, this is like throwing turd away before sprinting to try and catch it. ðŸ’©

### Don't modify the DOM in the middle of a Reflex

It is difficult but not impossible to change the DOM in the milliseconds between a Reflex action starting and finishing. Perhaps you have a `beforeReflex` client-side callback that wants to re-parent an element. Perhaps you use `CableReady#remove` to destroy the element that holds the `stimulus-reflex` controller element which initiated the Reflex.

However you got here, **please do not do this** or else you will see errors reported in your console inspector and the post-Reflex callbacks will never fire. This is because StimulusReflex expects to be able to locate the instance of the `stimulus-reflex` controller in the same position in your DOM hierarchy so that it can finish the transaction.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always pet cats _with_ the grain.
{% endhint %}

What we recommend instead is that you make use of the `finalizeReflex` callback to perform any desired DOM manipulations client-side _after_ the Reflex has fully completed running all operations.

### Don't change the URL rendered by a Reflex

While this comes up far less frequently now that we have Selector Morphs, we still occasionally get people asking to be able to change the URL which is used to morph the page. This is solidly in the **\#wontfix** category because the correct thing to do is just navigate to a new page.

When you do a Page Morph, StimulusReflex goes through a full Rails controller action + view rendering cycle before taking the result and passing it to morphdom. While the notion of changing which route is regenerated is seductive, it is really just another expression of the desire to see StimulusReflex as a shiny new hammer. In reality, StimulusReflex exists replace the need for reactive Single Page Applications - that's your clue. With StimulusReflex, you can design each page as though it's its own application. When you want to move to a new application, the browser should go to the new URL.

That said, it's easy to change the URL the user is looking at from the server when it's appropriate to do so. CableReady's `push_state` method allows you to drive the page the user sees from your server-side code.

If you need more control, you could also use CableReady's `dispatch_event` method to send an instruction to a Stimulus controller. Upon receving your event, you can easily initiate a Turbolinks [visit](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#turbolinksvisit), call [History.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) directly or just change the `window.location` if that's all you need.

### Don't initiate a Reflex when your page has finished loading

Regardless of whether you're talking about a Stimulus controller's `connect` method, jQuery's `load` event, a Turbolinks navigation event or your own [pageshow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageshow_event) event handler, we recommend that you don't attempt to immediate call a Reflex operation as soon as the page loads. This advice is especially important in the context of Page Morphs.

Best case, it's an extremely inefficient way to build your UI, since you should **just render the HTML you want to see** the first time. Worst case, you can find yourself in an infinite loop that wastes extraordinary bandwidth and resources.

The ideal way to think about a Page Morph is that you are updating the page to show the user what they would see if they hit the browser Refresh button right now. If you need to morph the page to finish rendering it, you should rework your program design so that you can render perfect HTML on the first pass.

No morph update should be required until some data is changed which impacts the DOM that is displayed to the user.

## Modifying the default data attribute schema

If you're stuck working with legacy applications that impose constraints on your data attribute naming scheme, Stimulus and StimulusReflex give you a mechanism to provide an alternative schema.

In addition to **controllerAttribute**, **actionAttribute** and **targetAttribute** as defined by Stimulus, StimulusReflex adds the following: **reflexAttribute**, **reflexPermanentAttribute**, **reflexRootAttribute** and **reflexDatasetAttribute**.

You can update these values by providing your own schema to `Application.start()`

{% code title="app/javascript/controllers/index.js" %}
```javascript
import { Application } from 'stimulus'
import { definitionsFromContext } from 'stimulus/webpack-helpers'
import StimulusReflex from 'stimulus_reflex'
import consumer from '../channels/consumer'

const application = Application.start(document.documentElement, {
  reflexAttribute: 'data-avenger'
})
const context = require.context('controllers', true, /_controller\.js$/)
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context))
StimulusReflex.initialize(application, { consumer })
StimulusReflex.debug = process.env.RAILS_ENV === 'development'
```
{% endcode %}

In the above example, you have now configured your application to parse your DOM for `data-avenger` attributes instead of `data-reflex` attributes. ðŸ¦¸

## Flight Safety Card

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're making changes to your Reflex classes, remember that you need to refresh your page in your web browser to allow ActionCable to reconnect to the server. You'll still be executing old code until you reconnect.

You can [setup webpack-dev-server to help](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/patterns#use-webpack-dev-server-to-reload-after-reflex-changes), however.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're collaborating with a team during development, **make sure that they have caching turned on**. They just need to run `rails dev:cache` one time.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember: putting `data-reflex="Foo#action"` on an element does **not** automatically attach an instance of the `foo` controller. If you need `foo` or any other Stimulus controllers on your elements, you have to attach them yourself.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
There's nothing about StimulusReflex 3+ that shouldn't work fine in a Rails 5.2 app if you're willing to do a bit of manual package dependency management.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It's important that you don't modify the hierarchy of your DOM while a Reflex action is running. This includes CableReady DOM operations broadcast inside of a Reflex, as well as Javascript in your `beforeReflex` callback.

{% hint style="info" %}
Are you finding that the [Trix](https://github.com/basecamp/trix) rich text editor isn't playing nicely with morphs? Our suggestion is to use [Selector Morphs](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/morph-modes#selector-morphs). If that's not possible, you might need to wrap it with a `data-reflex-permanent` attribute until we figure out what's up.
{% endhint %}

If your ActionCable is not connecting, make sure that you do not have an overly-restrictive [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/connect-src/) in place on your application. You can learn more in [this excellent article](https://bauland42.com/ruby-on-rails-content-security-policy-csp/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Getting weird Console Inspector errors? Make sure that your `stimulus_reflex` **npm** package version is **identical** to your Ruby **gem** version.

Do you have your `config/cable.yml` set up properly? We strongly recommend that you [install Redis](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/performance/installing_redis.html) as the adapter in development mode.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Are you using `ApplicationController.render` to regenerate partials that make use of view helpers? Are those helpers generating URL routes that point to `example.com`? You can fix this by setting up your [default\_url\_options](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/deployment#set-your-default_url_options-for-each-environment).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If your `data-reflex-permanent` isn't being respected, try adding a unique `id` parameter as well.

If _something_ goes wrong, it's often because of the **spring** gem. ðŸ’£ðŸ‘Ž

You can test this by temporarily setting the `DISABLE_SPRING=1` environment variable and restarting your server.

To remove spring **forever**, here is the process we recommend:

1. `pkill -f spring`
2. Edit your Gemfile and comment out **spring** and **spring-watcher-listen**
3. `bin/spring binstub --remove --all`
{% endhint %}

## Be realistic

We're very proud of StimulusReflex and CableReady, which are both standing on the shoulders of many giants such as Rails, Ruby and Redis.

However, we want to be the first to recognize that there are limitations and constraints you should consider before using these technologies in your applications. After all, Rails itself does not claim to be immune from side effects, though huge amounts of effort are being invested into improving Ruby's concurrency story even while you read this.

There are edge cases where data could become out of date in between the time a Reflex queries the database and the resulting DOM update is applied in the browser. While there are mitigation strategies \(such as tracking versions on everything\) which you could employ, it's important to remember that you could be opening a can of worms that leads to sadness and/or madness.

Please don't use StimulusReflex or CableReady to drive mission-critical and/or life-threatening situations. It is a terrible choice to re-write your laser vision correction servo motor controls with StimulusReflex. Don't pilot drones or operate heavy machinery that is controlled with StimulusReflex.

The only exception to the above is [Guntron](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/guntron/). StimulusReflex is perfect for [Guntron](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/guntron/).
